Notes to self, more than anything else
======================================

Releases
--------

1. Bump the version number. Maj.min.rev but when only making changes to the
   ancillary tools, rev is fine.
2. Set the version number in factory.js (near the end)
3. Set the version number in package.json
4. Make sure whatsnew.md has the correct heading
5. Commit. Tag the release "vX.Y.Z". Push the commit and the tag.
6. npm publish
